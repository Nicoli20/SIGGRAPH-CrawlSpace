First, Idea for a better name for the project: CrawlSpace.
Reason: It's a Dungeon Crawl in 3 dimensions, or a space.
Our opening could be someone actually went exploring in a 2D dungeon, in a small cramped area and was pulled in.

Idea for a level/boss arena: A Labyrinth. However the idea is a very old trope, so lets do something new.
Not only is there a Minotaur in there somewhere hunting you down, but it takes place in a house of mirrors,
with trick walls, one way passages that close behind you, and if you make too much noise, like during a fight with
a mook, the minotaur might hear you and charge in your direction through the mirrors smashing them as he goes.

The player should be able to smash mirros in this maze as well, but doing so would be loud an draw the attention of
the Minotaur.

Idea: Fonts look like they have the 3D effect on them. However they are built out of a simple 2D image in a font.png
file the player can easily replace if they want. In fact the player can replace the fonts with icons if they wish
by having a .xml file that loads the images for every monster and item at the start. The XML will list the file and
the position in the file the image can be found at. This allows for easy modding. Example .xml entry follows:

<creature = "Minotaur">
  <file = "Boss.png">
    <size>24</size>
    <row>3</row>
    <col>16</col>
    <color1>magenta</color1>
    <color2>green</color2>
    <color3>cyan</color3>
    <colorTransparent>purple</colorTransparent>
  </file>
</creature>

The row and column tags tell the program which row and column of the image the Icon can be found in, as well as the size telling
it how many pixels the icon is.

Colors 1-3 are different colors used by the .png to represent different highlights in the game for the font when used.
For example a kobold might be a green K, however it doesn't mean that the whole character must be green. Perhaps there could
be more nuance, like certain highlights that might glow or indicate what kind of weapon the kobold is wielding or armor he is
wearing. The transparancy color indicates which part of the image do not belong to the character.

More information about the monster can be added, including stats and the like, allowing easy modding by other people with
minimal knowledge required. Other tags like <hostile> or <immobile> and the like can affect it's behavior. This allows us to
create behaviors that are distinct from the monsters themselves, and players to create monsters as they want them.
